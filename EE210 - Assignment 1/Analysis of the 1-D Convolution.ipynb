    "The convolution operation is a fundamental operation on two functions $f$ and $g$ which produces a third function, that is typically viewed as a modified version of one of the original functions, giving the integral of the pointwise multiplication of the two functions as a function of the amount that one of the original functions is translated. Convolution is similar to _cross-correlation_.\n",

This means that given an LTI system, the complete system can be represented solely by its impulse response $h(t)$. _(Similar definition for discrete-time signals.)_"

    "As is clear from the definition, the convolution is an expensive operation and given the size of a typical sound clip $(10 sec \\rightarrow 1.6\\times10^5samples)$, the computation can be very intensive. But given the essentiality of the convolution as a fundamental property of an LTI system, and the immense number of applications, it cannot be ignored. Hence, we present an analysis of various ways to compute this convolution by employing certain other beautiful properties of this operation. We begin with algorithmic analysis for various methods to compute the convolution, and then go ahead to solve the actual problem with the best implementation. The topics covered are listed below:\n",
