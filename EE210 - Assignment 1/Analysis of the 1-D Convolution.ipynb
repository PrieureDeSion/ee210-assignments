    "## Motivation\n",
    "The convolution operation is a fundamental operation on two functions $f$ and $g$ which produces a third function, that is typically viewed as a modified version of one of the original functions, giving the integral of the pointwise multiplication of the two functions as a function of the amount that one of the original functions is translated. Convolution is similar to _cross-correlation_.\n",

    "For any physical _linear & time invariant (LTI)_ system $T$, it can be shown that the output of $T$ can be represented as $y(t) = x(t) * h(t)$, where $h(t)$ represents the response of $T$ to the unit impulse. This means that given an LTI system, the complete system can be represented solely by its impulse response $h(t)$. _(Similar definition for discrete-time signals.)_"
